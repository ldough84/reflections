Viewing a diff between the two files highlighted the areas in which there were 
changes between new and old.  This allowed me to skip all the content that 
remained the same and focus on areas that were possible culprits in the 
undesirable behavior we were looking for.

Manual commits allow the user to control what size logical chunks they need to
commit in order to keep the git log history clean and organized, and the
comments useful for understanding the purpose of the commit.  The danger you run
however, is that you may forget to commit for too long and lose work due to some
unforseen interruption.

It is more difficult to track changes across multiple files and not necessary i
most cases.  Google Docs has no need to implement this for the vast majority of
cases, but it is a crucial aspect of working on software projects.

Git log allow you a global view of all changes, git diff allows you to zoom in
on a specific set of changes.

Using version control allows you to easily revert changes, so if your software
fails critical tests, you can always revert to the last working copy.

Now that I am more familiar with Git, I'd like to use it to make my software 
projects simpler to manage, and stop worrying about making changes to them.
